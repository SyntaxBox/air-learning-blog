            <h2>Innovative Features</h2>
            <p>
              Google has focused, as usual, on introducing new features such as
              a 90Hz screen and Soli gestures, which allow users to control the
              phone remotely without touching it. Additionally, the advanced
              facial recognition technology enables phone unlocking from all
              directions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The camera capabilities have seen significant improvements. Thanks
              to the integration of Artificial Intelligence, the camera can now
              produce top-quality images even in low-light conditions. New
              features like rounding, star shooting modes, night mode, portrait,
              Live HDR+, Dual-exposure, and more have been added to enhance
              photography.
